# Vera Harmony Hub Plug in.

My Vera Plug in for interfacing with the Harmony Hub.

Version 3.0 is a complete rewrite. It keeps the connection with the Hub open all times and gets realtime updates on changes.

See http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,28689.0.html for details on how to use this with a Vera. On Vera it is best to install from Apps > Install apps and search for Harmony.

For openLuup install via the ALTUI App Store. You must also install the bit library (apt-get install lua-bitop).

Working on new userguide listing all new options.
