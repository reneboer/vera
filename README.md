# Vera Harmony Hub Plug in.

My Vera Plug in for interfacing with the Harmony Hub.

Form version 2.6 it also runs on openLuup.

See http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,28689.0.html for details on how to use this with a Vera. On Vera it is best to install from Apps > Install apps and search for Harmony.

For openLuup download all files to /etc/cmh-ludl and the .png files to /etc/cmh/skins/defaults/icons. The in ALTUI in the Devices menu select Create. Enter Device Name : Harmony Control, D_xxx.xml filename : D_Harmony.xml, I_xxx.xml filename : I_Harmony.xml. The relaod Luup and your browser and done.
