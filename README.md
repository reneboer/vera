# Vera Harmony Hub Plug in.

My Vera Plug in for interfacing with the Harmony Hub.

Version 3.0 is a complete rewrite. It keeps the connection with the Hub open all times and gets realtime updates on changes.

With Version 3.3 it also supports Phillis Hue Lights that can be controled via the Hub. Thusfar only tested with Color Lights.

See http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,28689.0.html for details on how to use this with a Vera. On Vera it is best to install from Apps > Install apps and search for Harmony.

For openLuup install via the ALTUI App Store. You must also install the bit library (apt-get install lua-bitop).
